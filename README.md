This assignment will be creating a webpage that contains a drag and drop feature that plays music when triggered.
Essentially it will be a webpage that has a "radio" design.
What I plan to create is a record player and a record stand with records. The records will be draggable and when "dropped" onto the record player it will play a song that is assigned to the record. 

The aesthetic that I will be going to use for the webpage styling will be a lo-fi chill vibe, with cats and a sleepy scene.
